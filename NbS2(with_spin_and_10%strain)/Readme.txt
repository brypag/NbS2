This file shows my reproduction attempt on the works of Yungang Zhou, et. al, "Tensile Strain Switched Ferromagnetism in Layered NbS2 and NbSe2" 

NbS2.scf.in - is the QE input file for scf calculation for NbS2 with 10% biaxial strain (applied by increasing the relaxed lattice parameter by 10%)

NbS2.bands_up.gnu - contains the bands data for spin up states.

NbS2.bands_down.gnu - contains the bands data for spin down states.

NbS2_up.png - is the electronic bands structure for spin up states.

NbS2_down.png - is the electronic bands structure for spin down states.

Nb(d)_dos.png - is the projected density of state of Nb with 10% biaxial strain at d-orbital.

Nb_d.pdos - contains the density of states data for Nb at d-orbital.
